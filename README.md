# Robotics
This repository includes some of the work I've done to practice robotics concepts.
I've purposely used MATLAB to write these scripts, even though other languages, such as Python, may have been more appropriate.

# Repository Contents:

**Exercises:** this subdirectory contains solutions to Robotics problems.

**ExtraWork:** this subdirectory contains pieces of extra work that I undertook to practice robotics concepts further.
